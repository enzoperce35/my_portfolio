        <h1>A Persevering Web Developer</h1>
        
        <p>
          Hi, I’m Edgar Lorenz Castro, an aspiring Web Developer with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React proficiency.
          I’m a self-thought programmer, motivated on putting myself in an industry where I think I belong.
          Driven with passion and guided by ’The Odin Project’;
          a free  full-stack Ruby on Rails Web Development course online which I started when I was 35 in year 2020,
          I am now able to put my ideas into real apps and web sites.
          While learning and making curriculum projects, I also made some side projects.
          Apps like Inventory, POS and other apps meant to automate tasks like Restaurant menu maker to Cryptocurrency movement tracker.
          I love making applications, I actually got plenty of ideas and I credit it from those non-tech years of my life where I do business.
          But my dream was with Tech Industries, I want to work with other devs, code in bigger websites, take its challenges, continue learning and make a bigger impact on people’s lives.
